What are cron, cron job, and crontab:
=======================================
Cron is a system that helps Linux users to schedule any task. However, a cron job is any defined task to run in a given time period. It can be a shell script or a simple bash command. Cron job helps us automate our routine tasks, it can be hourly, daily, monthly, etc.

Note: in most of Linux system, we must get a permission of system administrator before defining a spesific cron job that is listed on crontab

Meanwhile, the crontab stands for cron table. It is a Linux system file that contains a list of the cron job. 
We define our task — bash command, shell script, Python script, etc scheduled in crontab.

# Check cron service on Linux system
====================================
sudo systemctl status cron.service


cron job syntax
===============
It’s time to learn about cron job syntax on crontab.

crontab -a <filename>: create a new <filename> as crontab file
crontab -e: edit our crontab file or create one if it doesn’t already exist
crontab -l: show up our crontab file
crontab -r: delete our crontab file
crontab -v: show up the last time we have edited our crontab file

Syntax of crontab (field description):
=======================================

*     *     *     *     *  YOURCOMMAND
